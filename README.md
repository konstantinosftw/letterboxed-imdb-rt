# letterboxed-imdb-rt
Chrome extension that pulls IMdB and Rotten Tomatoes scores into Letterboxd movies.

# Caveat
This extension uses OMDb.com API, which is limited to 1000/day on a free API license key. Due to this limitation it is not uploaded to Chrome Store. Due to this restriction, you'll need to create your own free key and insert it into `lir.js` in order for the extension to work for you.

# How to install

1. Go to [OMDb.com/apikey](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx), enter your email and get a free API Key.
2. Download 'Letterboxd-imdb-rt' folder
3. Open `lir.js`, enter your `apikey` in the variable with the same name and save the file.
4. Go to Chrome menu -> Extensions -> Load Unpacked
5. Select the downloaded folder and you are done!
